## Risk Mitigation Planning
* **Weekly Risk Review**: Each sprint includes a dedicated risk review session
* **Risk Ownership**: Each identified risk has a designated owner responsible for monitoring and mitigation
* **Contingency Budget**: 20% time buffer allocated for critical path items
* **Escalation Path**: Clear escalation procedure for when risk factors exceed thresholds

## Technical Debt Management
* **Debt Tracking**: Technical debt items explicitly logged in project management system
* **Remediation Windows**: Specific time allocated in each sprint for addressing high-priority technical debt
* **Definition of Done**: Includes technical debt thresholds that must not be exceeded
* **Architecture Reviews**: Regular reviews to prevent architectural drift

## Future Phases (Post-May 2025)

The following sprints represent planned work after the initial 8-week delivery phase and will be refined based on outcomes from Sprints 1-4:

## Transition Plan to Future Phases

### Key Dependencies for Future Phase Success
- Successful completion of CRM pilot with positive user feedback
- Authentication service fully implemented and validated in production
- Data infrastructure providing reliable dashboard solutions
- AI conversation flows validated with stakeholders

### Go/No-Go Decision Criteria (End of Sprint 4)
- **Go Criteria**:
  - All critical path items in Sprints 1-4 successfully completed
  - No high-severity issues remaining unresolved
  - Business stakeholder sign-off on delivered components
  - Infrastructure capacity meets projected requirements
  
- **No-Go Criteria**:
  - Unresolved critical bugs in core functionality
  - Performance metrics not meeting minimum thresholds
  - Significant user experience issues identified during testing
  - Technical debt exceeding defined thresholds

### Contingency Planning
- Alternative deployment strategies if full scope cannot be delivered
- Phased rollout options to minimize business disruption
- Resource adjustment plans for high-demand teams
